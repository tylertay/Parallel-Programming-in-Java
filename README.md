# [Parallel Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java?)

### Concepts Learnt:
- Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
- Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
- Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
- Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
- Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

### Projects

1. Sum the reciprocals of array in parallel using ForkJoin framework
2. Analyze statics using Java Parallel Streams
3. Compute Matrix-Matrix Multiplication using loop-level parallelism
4. Implement one-dimensional iterative in parallel using Phasers to overlap computation with barrier completion
